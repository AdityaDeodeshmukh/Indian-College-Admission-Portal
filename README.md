## Project Domain

Fully functional web application

## Abstract:

A simple, yet user friendly web application which keeps track of the student’s admission procedure. The candidate can submit his/her application to multiple colleges with just a single form. One would have the ability to choose streams from a list of streams, and subsequently, the colleges from a list of available colleges. 

## Introduction:

Every year, millions of Indian students apply for their higher studies into various institutes. The entire procedure of applying to various institutes is a very tedious process. Added to that, every single application form requires almost the same set of details. A class 12 student is already burdened by the pressure of board exams and they have to take time off his studies and allocate time separately to fill out various application forms. There are so many streams and so many colleges to choose from which makes the entire admission procedure tedious. 

Our Student Admission Portal will make this job simple and intuitive to relieve students from this burden. It is a simple and user-friendly website which would keep track of the student’s admission procedure into the various institutes. Once signed up, each student can choose a list of colleges from a number of available colleges. They are then required to fill out a simple application form taking all the necessary details into account. Then the website would regularly send out updates on the application status of various institutes. This way, the process of admission is streamlined and the student does not have to fill out several forms of the same type. 

## Approach 

The admission portal is a simple. use-friendly web application designed to focus on the students. Once the user loads the website, a webpage would open up taking the user through the various features of the website. Once the user reads everything carefully, they can register with a link in the navbar. Once authenticated, the user would then have a dashboard where they would receive updates about the colleges they have applied for and interested in. Then, they can choose a particular stream from a list of available streams, after they can choose to apply for the colleges of their choice. The student can then proceed to fill up the application form and do the needful. The student can now view results from the results tab in the student dashboard. 

## Business Model:

The Business Model of ICAP would be as follows:
1.	We shall charge colleges a certain percentage of the admission fee of the student as commission.
2.	The other services like registration, discussion portal, and career recommendation system will be completely free
3.	Students only have to pay the admission fee for the colleges they apply for
4.	The data collected from the students will be kept secured on out servers
Target Audience:
The target audience for the portal would be students who have just completed 12th grade and are looking for their dream college. The colleges can contact us to have their admissions taken care of by us in return for some commission.

## Advantages of your Solution (ease of access, quick)

One of the major advantages of such a solution is that a student does not have to waste their precious time to fill out various application forms as this is just a single form taking all parameters. With just a tap of a few buttons any student can complete the college admission process within a few minutes. This also reduces the stress level among students as they can spend their time wisely and usefully on other important tasks. 

## Future Scope 

In the long run, the entire system would be available as a mobile application with some more features aimed at improving the student’s life. In case a student has doubts, he/she would be able to contact alumni from that particular college and a common discussion forum would also be made available where like-minded students can interact with each other regarding the admission process. 

## Ease of Implementation 

To implement this solution, there are a few challenges, the first being that of obtaining clearance from the institutes for carrying out such a task. The next task is to convince the authorities in the field of education and other higher authorities. The above mentioned are the major challenges in implementing this solution. However, since this application is for the students, hence with their support, it might become a possibility to make this application available for the masses.
